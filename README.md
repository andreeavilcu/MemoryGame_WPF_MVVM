# MemoryGame (WPF + MVVM)
This project is a C# and WPF implementation of the classic Memory game, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and leveraging Data Binding for UI logic separation.

The application allows users to create an account with a profile image, play the Memory game using customizable settings, save and load game progress, and view user statistics.

Features

-      Select and sign in with existing users
-      Delete user account (removes saved games and stats)
-     Standard 4x4 or custom-sized game board (even number of tiles, MxN format)
-      Three predefined image categories for game tiles
-      Timer with countdown (game must be completed within a time limit)
-     Save and load game at any time
-      Track and display game statistics: games played and games won
-       Menu navigation: File, Options, Help
